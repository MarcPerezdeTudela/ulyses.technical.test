# Instructions

### What’s included in this repository?
This repository contains a Spring Boot application with the following structure:

- The domain includes three entities: **Brand**, **Vehicle**, and **Sale**.
   - A Brand can have multiple Vehicles.
   - A Sale is associated with a Vehicle, a Brand, and a date.
- The application exposes a REST API that allows basic **CRUD operations**.
- Each entity is handled through its own **Controller**, **Service**, and **Repository**.
- The application uses **Spring Data JPA** to interact with the database.
- It uses an **H2 in-memory database**, preloaded with sample data, and is configured to run on port `8080`.

### What do you need to implement?

1. **Implement Spring Security:** 🟢
   - All **GET** endpoints must remain public (no authentication required). 🟢
   - All **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** endpoints must require authentication and authorization. 🟢

2. **Add the following endpoints to the `SalesController`:** 🟢
   - `GET /api/sales/brands/{brandId}` → Return all sales for a given brand. 🟢
   - `GET /api/sales/vehicles/{vehicleId}` → Return all sales for a given vehicle. 🟢
   - Modify the existing `GET /api/sales` endpoint and add pagination to it. 🟢
     - Each response must return **10 items per page**. 🟢
     - The **page number** must be accepted as an optional query parameter. 🟢
     - If the page number is not provided, the API should return the **first page by default**. 🟢

3. **Implement a new endpoint in `SalesController`:** 🟢
   - `GET /api/sales/vehicles/bestSelling` → Return the **top 5 best-selling vehicles**. 🟢
   - Allow optional filtering by **start date** and **end date**. 🟢
   - You must retrieve all sales from the database (as currently implemented). 🟢
      - **Do not use** SQL-level sorting, `Collections.sort()`, or any built-in sort utilities. 🟢
      - Implement your **own sorting logic** using Java code, considering performance (imagine millions of records). 🟢
      - You may create additional models or helper classes as needed.

4. **Create a custom filter or interceptor using Spring:** 🟢
   - It must **log all incoming API requests and outgoing responses** to a file. 🟢
   - The log must include:
      - Request date and time 🟢
      - HTTP method 🟢
      - Request URL 🟢
      - Response status code 🟢
      - Processing time (in milliseconds) 🟢

5. **Implement a caching system for the GET endpoints of Brand** 🟢
   - Check if the data exists in the cache and has not expired. 🟢
   - If it does not exist or has expired, call the supplier. 🟢
   - Update the cache with the new value. 🟢
   - Handle concurrency properly. 🟢

### Additional Information

- You must use **Java 21**.
- **Do not use any external libraries** — all code must be implemented by you.
- If there’s something you’re not sure how to do, don’t worry — just give it your best effort.
- We will carefully review your code and provide feedback as soon as possible.

### Final Solution

This is the final solution to the exercise. It includes all the required features and functionalities as specified in the instructions. 
I just want to add some information:
- The default user to test the application is:
  - **Username:** `user`
  - **Password:** `password`
- You will notice that you get long response times when you try to access the `/api/brands` GET endpoints. This is because the cache is not yet populated. Once you access the endpoint, the cache will be populated, and subsequent requests will be much faster. I added some delay intentionally to simulate a slow response time for the first request.
- I added some more sample data to the database to test the best-selling vehicles feature.
